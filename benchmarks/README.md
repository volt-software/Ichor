# Preliminary benchmark results
These benchmarks are mainly used to identify bottlenecks, not to showcase the performance of the framework. Proper throughput and latency benchmarks are TBD.

Setup: AMD 7950X, 6000MHz@CL38 RAM, ubuntu 22.04, gcc 11.3

# Conclusions?

These benchmarks currently lead to the following characteristics for Ichor:
* creating services with dependencies overhead is likely O(N²).
* Starting services, stopping services overhead is likely O(N)
* event handling overhead is amortized O(1)
* Creating more threads is not 100% linearizable in all cases (pure event creation/handling seems to be, otherwise not really)
* Latency spikes while scheduling in user-space is in the order of 100's of microseconds, lower if a proper [realtime tuning guide](https://rigtorp.se/low-latency-guide/) is used (except if the queue goes empty and is forced to sleep)

Help with improving memory usage and the O(N²) behaviour would be appreciated.

Also, Golang's fasthttp + go-json is really fast. Together with Ichor + Boost.BEAST, they are the only two tested solutions here that can handle 20,000 connections without errors. 
Although Ichor "cheats" in the sense that there is an extra thread doing the user logic separate from the networking thread, where other implementations had to do everything with 1 thread.   

# Possible improvements

* Linux-only: Implement I/O uring event loop for decreased syscalls
* Use libuv and modify hiredis implementation to use that instead of polling @ 1000Hz
